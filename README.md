# 🌙 LunaAylar Portfolio | Build Version (Unusable)

### "This is not the main version like the source code. its just the build version!"

Hello there! 👋 I'm **Aylar**, and if you've stumbled upon this repository, you're likely curious about how I built my portfolio.

This specific repository serves as the **Production Server** for [LunaAylar.iR](https://lunaaylar.ir). It contains the optimized, minified, and compiled assets designed to run lighting-fast on GitHub Pages/Servers.

## 🛠 Why is the code so "messy"?
If you're looking at the source files and seeing a wall of unreadable code—don't worry, I haven't lost my mind! 
* This is a **Build Version** (generated via Vite/React).
* It's minified to ensure the best performance for visitors.
* It's definitely not how I write code in my daily life!

## 🚀 Source Code
I believe in open source and sharing knowledge. I am currently cleaning up the **original source code** to make it readable and helpful for others.

**I will be publishing the full source code very soon!** Keep an eye on my profile.

Made with ☕ and a lot of late-night CSS tweaking.
